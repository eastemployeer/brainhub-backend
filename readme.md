# Prerequisites

- Node v16
- NPM v8
- Locally installed and running MongoDB (or dockerized with exposed port 27017)

### Getting started

- Check `.env` file. Edit it to match your environment (mongodb vars especially). I'm also setting some env variables in `test\unit\event.spec.js`.
- You have to have MongoDB up and running
- Run `npm i`
- Run `npm run dev`

## Running unit tests

- Run `npm run test`
